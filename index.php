<h1>Pathana Chonmany</h1>

<p>

Hello there! My name is Pathana, I am 21 years old and about to gradute college this coming Friday with my Bachelor of Science degree in Web Design & Interactive Media. I am planning on continuing my studies to get a Master's Degree. I initially intended to go to UMass Boston and master in IT there. But then I came across the IT graduate's program here at the Harvard Extension School and decided to give it a whirl and come here. I understand it will be a lot of work and I am definitely willing to put my all into my studies here. <p>
I am a web designer and developer, but I can also do more than just web things. I consider myself an all around <i>techy</i>. In my free time, I enjoy bike riding, being outdoors, spending time with family, playing video games, and listening to music. I recently just ended my job at Cheeseboy in South Station as a Shift Manager, because of graduating school soon so I will no longer be in the Boston area for 3 months.
